# Iggy Social: Empowering Decentralized Social Communication 

Social networks have transformed how people communicate and connect with each other, yet it's undeniable that centralization, surveillance, and censorship have plagued the current social media landscape. 

That's why there is a growing movement toward decentralization and Web3 Social protocols that aim to put users back in control.

### What is Iggy Social?

The mission of Iggy Social is to develop open-source Web3 Social clients, which can be used to build web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps, or any other types of frontends. 

Imagine Iggy Social as a sort of "Wordpress for Web3 Social." For example, you can take Iggy's web app template and use it to build your own web3 social site which is entirely decentralized and community-operated.

This is especially useful for any community that wants to have its own decentralized space to communicate, like a DAO that wants to have a space for its community to chat and coordinate. With Iggy, you can customize your social space as you want without being limited by centralized control.

### What tech does Iggy use?

Iggy is not opinionated about technologies. Any Web3 Social protocol could be used with Iggy, like Lens, Orbis, Farcaster, etc. 

Similarly, Iggy is not opinionated about other features such as usernames (ENS, Punk Domains, UD, etc.), image storage, DeFi integrations, etc. 

All these features will exist in the form of plugins, and anyone who uses an Iggy client template to set up a site/app will be able to choose which plugins to enable. Again, similar to plugins in Wordpress.

### Who is building and maintaining Iggyâ€™s open-source software? 
This will be Iggy DAO, which will be a community of people who work on developing and maintaining the codebase, but also doing other things like onboarding partners and other non-technical roles.

Iggy DAO does not yet exist, but the team of contributors is already forming and the first client/frontend is being developed. If you'd like to join, don't hesitate and reach out (via the [comments here](https://github.com/orgs/iggy-social/discussions/1)) - any skills are welcome!

### Vision

Our vision is a world where communication is free of centralized control. Where people do not fear deplatforming. And where anyone can earn with their content. 

At Iggy Social, we believe that Web3 Social is the future of communication, and we are committed to providing the tools for anyone to build their own decentralized social space. 

Join us in creating a more free, decentralized, and democratic world!
